# Energy Usage in European Union

This repository contains the cod and data for the lecture DOPP WS23 on the topic of energy usage and development in European Union.


## Run the Code

To run the code one needs to install conda and create an environment using the `environment.yml` file. This virtual environment can then be used to run the notebook. The environment will have the name `dopp`.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dopp
```

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to answer the following questions:
1. How has European Unionâ€™s dependence on different types of fossil and renewable fuels changed since 2010?
2. What are the primary industrial and domestic uses of fossil and renewable fuels in European Union, and how have these usages changed since 2010?
3. How do fluctuations in electricity and natural gas end-user prices, affect the consumption of these goods
(correlation, other influences)? How do they affect the share of renewable energy in gross final energy
consumption?
4. Identify the main external and internal sources of fossil fuels for European Union. How has the reliance on these
sources shifted over time?

## Story

"Through this analysis of European Union's energy data we want to show how close is this region to successfully transitioning away from fossil fuels, and what might be still key obstacles need to be addressed."
