# Academic Project Portfolio - Technical University of Vienna

This repository contains several projects completed as part of coursework during my bachelor's and master's studies at the Technical University of Vienna. Each project folder includes a detailed README describing the project’s objectives, key features, and instructions for use. Below is a brief overview of each project.

**Note**: These projects were developed as part of university coursework and may not be fully polished or production-ready.

## Projects

**Energy Usage in European Union**
- **Description**: This project analyzes the European Union's energy usage trends, exploring fossil and renewable energy consumption patterns, dependency shifts, and the impact of pricing on energy sources. The analysis addresses key questions about the EU’s energy transition.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Topics**: Data Analysis, Energy Policy, Visualization

**FPGA Retro Ball Game**
- **Description**: This project implements a classic arcade-style game on an FPGA, where the player navigates a falling ball through obstacles to avoid collisions and score points. The game leverages VHDL to manage game logic, control inputs, video output, and scoring, delivering a retro gaming experience on a black-and-white display.
- **Tools**: VHDL, NES Controller Interface, Video Signal Generation
- **Topics**: Digital Design, Game Development, FPGA Programming

**LED Matrix Game**
- **Description**: Developed an interactive game on an LED matrix where players control a character to reach a randomly placed target using a joystick. The project includes real-time score updates sent via USART to a connected device.
- **Tools**: C programming, STM32 microcontroller, USART communication
- **Topics**: Embedded Systems, Microcontroller Programming, Real-Time Communication

**MiRiV RISC-V Processor**
- **Description**: A minimal RISC-V processor created using VHDL, featuring a pipeline architecture, memory management, and hazard resolution mechanisms. The processor supports a subset of the RISC-V instruction set and was tested extensively with simulation.
- **Tools**: VHDL, Quartus, ModelSim
- **Topics**: Digital Design, Computer Architecture, Simulation

**Personalized Daily Travel Assistance Service - Enterprise Architecture Project**
- **Description**: Designed an IT architecture for a Personalized Daily Travel Assistance Service that offers AI-driven travel advice based on real-time data. The project includes a strategy model, architecture principles, and an outline of business processes.
- **Tools**: ArchiMate, Enterprise Architecture
- **Topics**: Enterprise Architecture, Technology Innovation, Transportation

**Productivity Analytics for Garment Industry**
- **Description**: A data analytics project to predict productivity in the garment industry using machine learning. The project follows the CRISP-DM framework, with a focus on data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment considerations.
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-Learn
- **Topics**: Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics
