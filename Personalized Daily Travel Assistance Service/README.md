# Personalized Daily Travel Assistance Service - Enterprise Architecture Project

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of an Enterprise Architecture course at the Technical University of Vienna. The assignment involved creating an initial organizational and IT architecture for a **Personalized Daily Travel Assistance Service** aimed at enhancing daily travel experiences. The proposed service leverages AI to offer dynamic, personalized travel advice based on real-time and predicted travel data, integrating with various channels for a seamless user experience.

## Objectives
The key objectives of this project were:
1. **Developing an ArchiMate Strategy Model**: Outline the strategy required for launching and sustaining the travel assistance service, focusing on essential resources, capabilities, and action steps.
2. **Formulating Architecture Principles**: Define guiding principles for scalability, personalization, and accessibility to shape the design and implementation of the service.
3. **Sketching Business Processes and Services**: Provide an initial structure of the core business processes and services needed to support the travel assistance platform.
4. **Designing IT Architecture**: Define the application and technology layers needed to support the business processes, ensuring seamless integration across layers.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Personalization**: The service dynamically adapts to users' travel habits and preferences, forecasting traffic patterns and suggesting optimal routes based on real-time data.
- **Multi-Modal Transportation Support**: Assists users with various modes of transportation, including public transport, taxis, and personal/shared vehicles.
- **Comprehensive User Experience**: Integrates with popular calendar systems and supports multiple interaction channels (e.g., voice assistants, chat interfaces) to provide personalized and accessible travel advice.
